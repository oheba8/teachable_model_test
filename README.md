# teachable_model_test


🧠 Task Description
This task involves creating an image recognition model using Google Teachable Machine. The model should be trained to recognize at least two different classes and then evaluated for accuracy.

🎯 1. Model Training
Use the Teachable Machine platform to create an image classification model.

Train the model using a minimum of two distinct classes (e.g., cats vs. dogs, or fruits vs. vegetables).

Collect and upload appropriate images for each class.

Complete the training process through the platform.

💾 2. Model Export
After training, export the model in TensorFlow → Keras format.

This format will allow you to use the model in a Python environment.

You will receive files including the main model file (e.g., model.h5).

🐍 3. Python Script for Prediction
Create a Python script to test the exported model. The script should:

Import necessary libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, PIL).

Load the model file.

Open and preprocess a test image (resize to 224x224 pixels and normalize).

Run a prediction and display the predicted class result.

📎 4. Submission Requirements
You are required to submit the following:

The Python script used to test the model.

The exported model files from Teachable Machine.

A screenshot showing the script running and displaying the predicted result.
